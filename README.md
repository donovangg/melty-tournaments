## Melty Tournaments.

This was originally a prototype for a website using NextJS and Supabase for the backend for people to post upcoming Melty Blood Type Lumina tournaments. Unfortunately the game hasn't popped off as much as I'd like to hope. Will soon update for all fighting games.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
